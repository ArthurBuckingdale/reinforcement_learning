The purpose of this document is to create an 'orbital drop' care package delivery system. We want to avoid the use of liquid rockets as they are complicated. Solid boosters
are a much more simple design. We will begin here with a brief explanation of the object I intend to model.
	The orbital drop box is a cube, which is not terribly aerodynamic, but this is a first simulation after all and those forces are not included. They will be. 
for now, we have a cube falling from the sky with a solid rocket booster attached to each corner of the cube. The boosters can change angle relative to the cube and they will do 
so along the diagonal axis. With this they can control the x,y,z position of the falling cube, plus the various rotations induced by the fall, or by the rockets making maneuvers
	The solid rockets will ofcourse run out of fuel after a certain amount of time and the cube will fall from the sky if it's not on the ground already.
