# reinforcement_learning
 Using the MATLAB frame work to complete various tasks in reinforcement learning. A certain fraction of these will be borrowed examples from the 
MATLAB  examples that I will modify and are therefore not 100% original content. I also intend on applying some reinforcement learning to the 
code which I have developed in the Physics repository.
	Initially, some of the code will be modifications of the MATLAB examples as I need to learn. As time progresses, they will become more and more
custom. 
	The directories in here are each different examples where I needed to complete a different goal. For example, the solid_rocket_lander project is just a 
slightly modified version of the MATLAB RocketLander class. Where as the three_dim_solid_rocket_lander is intended for real world application and I will be
adding a lot of my own input physics to the class.
