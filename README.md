# reinforcement_learning
 Using the MATLAB frame work to complete various tasks in reinforcement learning. A certain fraction of these will be borrowed examples from the 
MATLAB  examples that I will modify and are therefore not 100% original content. I also intend on applying some reinforcement learning to the 
code which I have devellopped in the Physics repository.
